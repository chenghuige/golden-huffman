I.How to build?
1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
will generate ./utet which is a test of the compressor and decompressor
the source code of the test is /unit_ests/test.cc


II.File structure
1./include
  All source code relating to compressor/encoder and decomressor/decoder
  Decoder is in the same file of encoder,ie encoder.h will provide
  class Encoder and Decoder  normal_huff_encoder.h will provide 
  both class NormalHuffEncoder and NormalHuffDecoder
2./utils
  Helper classes.Right now only
  /utils/include/buffer.h
  provide the help of buffered file read write.
3./unit_tests
  The unit tests and show how to use the compressor and decompressor.
  Ringht now only test.cc

III.Dependence
  With out setting DEBUG2,DEBUG,
  int /build
  cmake -DDEBUG2=off -DDEBUG=off ..
  cmake ..
  make
  We need nothing else.
  
  If setting DEBUG,will print log and also running tests.
  You need to install google test for /unitest/tests.cc
  I may also in source files using google test in DEBUG mode.

  If setting DEBUG2
  We use this mode to print the huff_tree created in normal huff encodeing.
  So if you do not care this feature,do not turn it on.
  This feature will depend on 
  python, boost.python, pygraphviz.
  So you need to have python installed with shared lib,also install boost.python
  and pygraphviz.

  Please see CMakeLists.txt in the top dir, you may need to change the specific
  include directories and lib link directories.

Thanks:)
